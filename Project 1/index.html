      <h1>Where Are You Going</h1>
      <h2>By Dave Matthews</h2>
      <p>Where are you going
With your long face
Pullin' down
Don't hide away,
Like an ocean
That you can't see
But you can smell
And the sound of waves crash down.
I am no superman
I have no reasons for you.
I am no hero,
Aw that for sure,
But I do know one thing,
That's where you are is where I belong.
I do know
Where you go,
Is where I wanta be. <br />
