## **My Struggles With Web Design**
I had many struggles my first week of learning about how to create my *first web page*. I was able to follow along with the more simple things, such as downloading applications and creating files. When it came to actually using those applications that I have never even heard of before, I became very lost and confused.
- I looked through the information on Moodle.
- I read the instructions found in GitHub.
- I did everything I could to Figure this out on my own, but it just wasn't working out so well.

## **What helped Me**
1. I asked my professor for help
2. Justine(Web Design Professor)showed me the basics and got me caught up to speed.

I have always been more of a visual learner so going in and meeting up with someone who can show me how to use these new programs is really great. Then I am able to go do these things on my own.

Creating the correct folders in the correct place was the easy part.
