<H2>My Struggles With Part One of Project 2:</H2>
<body>
Still trying to get used to working with markdown. I can memorize some of them but not all. I had troubles getting this from Atom to Github for some reason and it took me the longest to figure it out, but I was just making a simple stupid mistake. Guess I forgot to turn my brain on. </body>
<H2> How I Accomplished This Assignment</H2>
<body>
Coding has always been a struggle for me so I did have to use the markdown cheatsheet for a lot of this. The reason I had trouble getting my index.html onto Github is because I forgot to save this to my file first so then it wouldn't show up there and I was really confused, but I thought it through and finally figured it out... Stress panick over silly mistakes makes me angry.
